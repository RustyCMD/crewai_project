Based on the logs you provided, you are running the project correctly, but there are two code errors in the provided project files that are causing the crash. The "Full Launch" (Option 3) fails because of a bug in the dashboard code and a configuration issue in the agent definitions.

Here is how to fix these files to get the GUI and agents running.

1. Fix the Dashboard Crash (collaboration_dashboard.py)
The error Monitor error: 'AgentCommunicationHub' object has no attribute 'lock' happens because the dashboard is trying to use a thread lock that was removed from the communication hub (which now uses file locking instead).

File: crewai_project/collaboration_dashboard.py Line: Approx 284 (inside monitor_collaboration method)

Change this:

Python

                # Check if communication file exists
                if os.path.exists(comm_hub.communication_file):
                    # FIX: Use comm_hub.lock to prevent race conditions when reading JSON file
                    with comm_hub.lock:  # <--- DELETE THIS LINE
                        data = comm_hub._read_data() # <--- UNINDENT THIS
To this:

Python

                # Check if communication file exists
                if os.path.exists(comm_hub.communication_file):
                    # FIX: Use comm_hub.lock to prevent race conditions when reading JSON file
                    # (Locking is now handled internally by _read_data)
                    data = comm_hub._read_data()
2. Fix the Agent Validation Error (collaborative_agents.py)
The error The crew must end with at most one asynchronous task occurs because CrewAI requires the final task in the list to be synchronous (blocking) to know when the process is complete. Currently, all tasks are set to async_execution=True.

File: crewai_project/collaborative_agents.py Line: Approx 266 (inside create_collaborative_tasks function)

Find the file_lock_task definition (the last task) and change async_execution to False.

Change this:

Python

    # File Lock Manager Task
    file_lock_task = Task(
        description="""Manage file access coordination...""",
        # ... (other arguments) ...
        agent=file_lock_manager_agent,
        async_execution=True  # <--- CHANGE THIS TO False
    )
To this:

Python

    # File Lock Manager Task
    file_lock_task = Task(
        description="""Manage file access coordination...""",
        # ... (other arguments) ...
        agent=file_lock_manager_agent,
        async_execution=False  # <--- This fixes the validation error
    )
3. Run the Project Again
After saving both files, run the launcher again:

Open your terminal in crewai_project/.

Run: python launch_collaborative_development.py

Select Option 3 (Full Launch).

The dashboard should now open without the "monitor error," and the agents should initialize successfully without the validation crash.
